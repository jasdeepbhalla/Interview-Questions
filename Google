Implement a class that can calculate the running average of a stream of input numbers up to a maximum of N numbers. 

Implement string rotateString(string input, int amt) 
  
Implement int strncmp(const char* s1, const char* s2, int n) 

Implement a function that takes the set-wise subtraction of two sorted sets of integers. ie A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {3, 4, 5} => A - B = {1, 2}. There can be duplicates, in which case all duplicates should be removed should there be an occurrence in B. IE: {1, 2, 3, 3, 3} - {2, 3} = {1}.
